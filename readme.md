# SGrJavaIntermediary
## Introduction

The SGrJavaIntermediary application allows access to SmarGridready compliant devices through a
WEB-Service API. Developers of SGr communicator applications such as energy-manager applications
can use the SGrJavaIntermediary instead of integrating a SmartGridready commm-handler library in
Java or Python.

The SGrJavaIntermediary acts as a bridge between the communicator application and the SmartGridready
compliant devices.

This solution is particularly useful for applications written in programming languages that do not have an available 
SmartGridready commhandler library.

## Installation

Currently proposed installation variant is to use the SGrIntermediary docker image.
